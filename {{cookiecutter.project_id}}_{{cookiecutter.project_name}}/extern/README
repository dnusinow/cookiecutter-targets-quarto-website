Files created by programs external to the scripts contained in the analysis
directory should go here. For example, if an exported data file is manually
processed through an external program or website (e.g. Cytoscape) exported files
from that external program (e.g. manually created network plots) should be
placed in this directory to clearly indicate that they were not generated from
the code contained in this repository.
